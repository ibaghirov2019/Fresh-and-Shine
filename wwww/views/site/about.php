<h4>OUR STORY</h4>
<p>Fresh & Shine was founded in September 2017  by the ADA University students who are 3th year students. There was no easy way. Two or three months later, the project was already ready, and it worked in Azerbaijan. They developed Fresh-and-Shine to fill that void, with the goal of building the easiest, most convenient way for busy people everywhere to book household services.

<h4>Thank you to the many people who helped Fresh-and-shine get started.</h4>
<p>Ignacio Leonhardt and Weina Scott were the first members of the founding team at Fresh & Shine. After spending 9 months working with Fresh & Shine, Ignacio moved back to Guatemala and is now running his family's business. Weina worked with Fresh & Shine for 7 months, building the first version of the website, and now works on another startup in California. Bob Davis and Jeremiah Daly from Highland Capital Partners invested the first capital in Fresh & Shine, followed by Joel Cutler and Nitesh Banta from General Catalyst Partners, David Tisch and Adam Rothenberg from Box Group, and Art Papas. Andrew Lurvey was Fresh & Shine's first operations team member. Andrew joined Fresh & Shine when we were four people in a small room. He spent two years working with Fresh & Shine while we've grown to over 200 hundred people in 28 cities.

<h4>Thank you to the many people who've subsequently joined the team and invested in Fresh & Shine. It's because of your help that we're well on our way to changing the way the world buys services.
